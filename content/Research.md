**Next generation knock down tools based on the structure and characterization of Cas13e3**
CRISPR-Cas13 system is widely used in the RNA targeting and viral RNA detetation. However the collateral activity and the controlability of Cas13 limit the application of Cas13 in gene theraputics. Here, we reveal the Cryo-EM structure of Cas13e3, which is the minist Cas13 to date, binary, ternary, and quaternary complex. With the combination of optogenetics tools and Cas13 protein engineering, we create the next generation gene knock down tools with high efficidency and minimal cis cleavage, which can be used on single cell with light operation.
